Welcome to the VATprism repository! VATprism is a data explorer for [VATSIM](https://www.vatsim.net/), the
**V**irtual **A**ir **T**raffic **Sim**ulation Network. VATprism allows users to explore available ATC services,
connected pilots, Airports, Flight and Upper Information Regions and more!

## Motivation

VATprism was born out of a desire to simplify, and make more customizable, access to VATSIM data and is inspired by the
excellent [VAT-Spy](http://www1.metacraft.com/VATSpy/), which, as of this time, unfortunately remains closed source.

## Download

For instructions on how to download VATprism, see the [Installation](#installation) section of this readme.

## Issues

Issue tracking takes place on this GitHub issue repository. You are most invited to contribute bugs, issues, feature or
any other constructive feedback [as an issue.](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/issues) Before submitting an issue,
please check existing issues for duplicates.

## Installation

#### Windows

Simply download the latest installer (`.msi`) from
the [releases page](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/releases/latest)
and run it. The installer will guide you through the installation.

Note: Windows Defender SmartScreen might show [a warning](docs/assets/images/warning.png) about the installer not being
a recognized app. This is harmless and simply an issue of the installer
being [unsigned.](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/microsoft-defender-smartscreen/microsoft-defender-smartscreen-overview)

#### macOS

Simply download the latest image (`.dmg`) from the [releases page](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/releases/latest)
and run it.

Note: macOS might warn you that VATprism can not be trusted because it has been downloaded from the internet. To open
VATprism anyway, right click it and press open. Additionally, after updating, you might receive a message saying the
application is damaged and cannot be opened. This is an issue with codesign. Navigate to `/Applications/` and
run `codesign --remove-signature VATprism.app`, then start VATprism as usual. I hope to be able to resolve this issue in
the future, see the [corresponding issue](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/issues/30) for more information.

#### Linux

Currently, there is no support for native linux binaries. It is still possible to run VATprism, though you are going to
have to compile it yourself. For this, please refer to the [Build](#build) section of this readme.

If there is demand for Linux native binaries in the future, I will think about adding support. Feel free to
request [Linux](https://github.com/marvk/vatprism/issues/31) builds via the linked issue.

## Build

Building the project requires the following tools:

* [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

* [JDK 15+](https://adoptopenjdk.net/)

* [WiX Toolset](https://wixtoolset.org/) (Windows Only, version 3 required)

To build the project, clone the repository and run `mvn package`. To run the project, navigate to `target-fat-jar` and
run `java -jar vatsim-map-[VERSION]-fat.jar`

## Acknowledgements

VATprism uses the [VAT-Spy Client Data Update Project](https://github.com/vatsimnetwork/vatspy-data-project) as a source
of static data and the [VATSIM API](https://api.vatsim.net/api/) as a source of dynamic data.
