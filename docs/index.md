## Why VATprism?

VATprism has been build from the ground up to offer a no-fuss experience into the world of VATSIM data. VATprism makes
it easy to find Flights, Airports and other Data and navigate between that data. It offers fully customizable color
schemes, allowing you to adjust the interface colors to your liking. VATprism also allows you to create an unlimited
amount of filters, marking flights you are interested in with any color you prefer.
